Demo version of the Empa dashboard for GAW stations.

The dashboard requires the upload of one csv or xls file with hourly mole fraction measurements of either carbon monoxide (CO) or ozone (O3) for the station of Rigi. A few of such files are provided in the folder `examples` (note that the timestamps are in UTC).
